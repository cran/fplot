Description: Easy way to plot regular/weighted/conditional distributions by using formulas. The core of the package concerns distribution plots which are automatic: the many options are tailored to the data at hand to offer the nicest and most meaningful graphs possible -- with no/minimum user input. Further provide functions to plot conditional trends and box plots. See <https://lrberge.github.io/fplot/> for more information.
